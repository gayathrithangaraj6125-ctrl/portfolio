📚 **Library Book Demand Prediction App — Machine Learning Project**

Excited to share my end-to-end Machine Learning project — from data preprocessing to live deployment! 🚀

I built a **Library Book Demand Prediction App** that predicts book demand based on features like rating, pages, publish year, and review counts.

🔍 What this project includes:
• Data cleaning and preprocessing
• Model training using Scikit-learn
• Saving the model using Joblib
• Interactive web app built with Streamlit
• Deployment on Render

This project helped me understand the complete ML workflow:
Dataset → Model Training → Model Saving → Web App → Cloud Deployment.

🛠 Tech Stack:
Python | Pandas | Scikit-learn | Streamlit | Joblib | Git | GitHub | Render

🔗 Live App:
https://library-ml-project.onrender.com

💻 GitHub Repository:
https://github.com/gayathrithangaraj6125-ctrl/library-ml-project

Proud to take my ML model from local development to a live deployed application!
